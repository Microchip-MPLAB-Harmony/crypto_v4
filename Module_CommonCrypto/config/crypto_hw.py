#### Function to Instantiate the Harmony 3 TM Component - dynamic    
#### Crypto V4 API Library Component - specific to processor
#
# Description:
#    Function that is called during component activation (added to the project
#    graph). The component is allowed to establish dependencies and create
#    symbols.
#     --Code is generated later based on configuration settings
#
# Parameters:
#    component (LocalComponent) â€“ local interface to the newly added component
#    [index (integer)] - for instanced components only, indicates the instance index
#
#### NOTE(s): 
####    1) crypto component module defined by module.py in crypto/config
